PROJECT TITLE : VIDYUTH VERSE -  "Renewable Energy Dashboard for India"

PROBLEM STATEMENT - Accelerate renewable energy deployment across regions and carbon calculation

DESCRIPTION OF AI USAGE - This project was developed using Lovable AI, an AI-powered development assistant that simplifies web app creation through natural language prompts.

Lovable AI helped in:

Generating the frontend and backend code structure for the dashboard.
Designing responsive UI components using React and Tailwind CSS.
Assisting in API integration and database connectivity with PostgreSQL.
Enabling rapid prototyping and quick feature iteration during development.
Lovable AI significantly accelerated the overall build process, allowing the team to focus more on data analysis and functionality rather than repetitive coding tasks.
